haptic-controller
=================

When combined with a Haptic Tactor or Tactor Strip creates a string of haptic devices. Presumably you can attach a ton of those in a row. Right now theres a software limit of 16 tactors which will be fixed soon. The next limit is voltage drop over wires. I'm not sure what we're looking at for that yet. Finally the next limit is tactors on at a time. The current amperage limit is 1 amp or about 10 tactors on at a time, but feel free to push it.

Utilize BRD and SCH file in Eagle 5 to take a look at the board, make changes, and generate your own gerbers. Sorry, transition to Eagle 6 soon probably.

Utilize BOM file to order parts (Part Numbers included for digikey) to build your own or fix existing.
